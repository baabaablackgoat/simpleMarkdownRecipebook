## Tags: Zimt, süß, aufwändig

## Ingredients
- 455g bread flour
- 200g white sugar
- 240g powdered sugar
- 50g brown sugar
- 200g soft butter
- 225g buttermilk
- 225g cream cheese, at room temp.
- 1 cube or packet of yeast
- 1 egg
- 1 lemon zest
- 1½ Tbsp cinnamon
- ½ tsp salt
- Some heavy cream (if necessary)
- Vegetable oil

## Method
1. In a stand mixer, combine 95g of granulated sugar, ½ tsp of salt, and 85g of soft butter. Mix slowly at first, but increase to medium high speed. Mix for about 1 minute or until fluffy.
2. Scrape down the sides of the bowl before adding 1 whole egg and the zest of one lemon. Mix on medium high for about 2 minutes.
3. Next, add 455g of bread flour along with 1 cube/packet of instant yeast and 225ml of buttermilk. Use the paddle attachment and mix on medium low speed until just combined. Clean off paddle attachment and affix dough hook. Mix with the dough hook for about 10 minutes on medium speed.
4. Place dough into an oiled bowl and make sure it’s big enough for the dough to double in size. Cover with plastic wrap and let sit for 2 hours.
5. Oil your work surface and your rolling pin, and then turn out the dough.
6. Knead for a minute to get all the air out and then roll out the dough to about 14 x 18 inches.
7. In a bowl combine 100g white sugar, 1½ tbsp cinnamon, and 50g of brown sugar. Mix to combine and then generously sprinkle that over your rolled out dough. Once your dough is covered, roll it up.
8. Place seam side down and trim off about 1 inch from either end, then slice the rest into 12 equal slices.
9. Oil and add parchment paper to a large baking dish, and then add your cinnamon rolls. Make sure they have about ½ an inch of space between them. Cover and proof them for 90 minutes.
10. Prepare the frosting before the rolls are done: In a mixer combine 240g sifted powdered sugar, 225g room temperature cream cheese, and 115g of room temperature butter. Mix to combine. Set aside until rolls are done baking.
11. Remove plastic wrap and brush the tops of the rolls down with melted butter. Place in the oven at 190°C, 170-175°C for convection, for about 20-30 minutes or until brown.
12. Remove from oven, let cool for 5 minutes (avoid waiting for much longer) and top with frosting. Remove rolls as a whole from the baking dish, and place on a wire rack. Pull apart, serve, and enjoy!
